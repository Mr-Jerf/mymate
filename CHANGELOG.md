# Changelog

All notable changes to My Mate are recorded here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

**Maintaining this file** (see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#cutting-a-release)): keep an
`Unreleased` section at the top and add entries there as you go, grouped under
Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed. When you cut a release, rename `Unreleased` to
the new `vX.Y.Z` with the date, bump the root `VERSION` file to match, then tag.
Write it for a human deciding whether to upgrade - one line per change, not a dump
of commit subjects.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- **A full page per device, LibreNMS style (GitHub #28).** Open a device from the Devices list or with
  "Open device page" in the map inspector and you get /devices/{id} with Overview, Graphs, Ports, Events
  and Config tabs. The Graphs tab shows every history we keep for the device (traffic for the whole box
  and per port, latency / loss / jitter, CPU, memory, temperature, sensors, wireless, probes, and anything
  new we start recording) over 1h to 1y or a custom window. Every graph shares the range and the hover
  crosshair, drag across any graph to zoom in, Back undoes the zoom, and "compare to previous period"
  lays last week (or whatever the span is) over this one. Each graph has a min / avg / max / last table
  underneath, traffic adds the 95th percentile, and graphs export to CSV or PNG. The range lives in the
  URL, so a link opens the same view. Graphs only load as you scroll to them, so a big switch stays quick.
- **95th percentile billing per port.** Click a port on the Ports tab for its own page: traffic,
  utilisation and whatever else is recorded for it, plus a billing panel for this month, last month or
  any dates you pick. It shows the 95th percentile of the 5 minute rates in, out and max(in, out) with the
  top 5% of intervals dropped, and the data transferred each way, and can draw those lines on the traffic
  graph. Tick other ports to bill them as one (summed per interval, then the percentile). Periods that
  start before the 5 minute rollups are kept fall back to hourly averages and say so, since that reads low.
- **Device events timeline.** Outages, alerts firing and clearing, config changes from backups, the last
  upgrade and the last reboot, merged newest first on the device page's Events tab.
- **Play back the geo map's history (GitHub #22).** A map in geographic mode has a new History button
  next to the map picker. It swaps the live view for a playback bar: pick the last 1h, 6h, 24h or 7 days,
  then scrub, step, or play it at 1x to 8x. Link
  colours and load labels, device up/down and ping latency all show what they were at that moment,
  coloured exactly like the live map, and red marks on the timeline show where devices went down (click
  one to jump there). Down comes from the recorded outages, so even a 30 second drop shows on a 5 minute
  frame. The banner says PLAYBACK and the time while you're in it, live updates can't change what you're
  looking at, and Live takes you back with everything refreshed. Long windows read the 5 minute and hourly
  history rollups, and big maps load in chunks so it can start playing while the rest arrives. Restricted
  operators only get playback for maps they've been given.
- **Playback on the regular map too, with CPU / memory / temperature and the inspector following
  along (GitHub #22).** The non-geo map has the same History button and bar, with links coloured the
  same way as live and cards locked in place while you look back. Device cards now show the CPU, memory
  or temperature they had in each frame instead of going blank, on both maps. Click a device during
  playback and the inspector shows that frame too, status, latency and loss, CPU / memory / temperature
  and the traffic on its linked ports, under a "Viewing <time>" banner with a way back to live. Typing a
  date and time and hitting Go now shows the network at exactly that moment (the few minutes of samples
  up to it, and who was down right then), and "Scrub around it" opens an hour either side in one minute
  frames.
- **Port errors, discards and packets are graphed now.** Every interface keeps in / out errors,
  discards and packets per second as history, rolled up to a year like traffic, plus the port's up /
  down state over time (as % up). Over SNMP the counters are read once a minute by default
  (`MYMATE_PORT_STATS_INTERVAL`), only for the ports we already know, packed into a few GETs; over the
  RouterOS API they come free with every poll. The Counter32 error counters are wrap safe, and a reboot
  resetting them doesn't draw a spike. The latest rates are on each interface in the API too.
- **Disk and memory usage per device.** The HOST-RESOURCES storage table (disks, RAM, swap, flash) is
  read on the metrics cadence, kept as each device's current storage list
  (`GET /api/devices/{device}/storage`) and graphed per entry. RouterOS boxes polled over the API report
  their memory and system disk. Reading it walks the storage table once instead of three times, so memory
  polling got a little cheaper.
- **Load per CPU core.** Each processor's load is kept and graphed alongside the overall CPU figure,
  with the current per-core values at `GET /api/devices/{device}/processors`.
- All of these show up on the device page by themselves (Graphs tab sections for packets, errors and
  discards, port status, storage, per-core CPU, uptime and optical power; the Ports tab gets its errors
  column).
- **Uptime history and every reboot on the Events tab.** Uptime is read on every metrics poll now (not
  only at discovery) and graphed, so a reboot shows as the line dropping to zero. Each reboot the poller
  catches is also kept and listed on the device page's Events tab with how long the box had been up,
  instead of only the latest boot.
- **Optical power history.** SFP Rx / Tx light levels are kept as history per port, not just the latest
  reading, so a slowly dying optic or a dirty patch is easy to spot.
- Remote agents report all of the above for their devices too (update the agent to get it; older agents
  keep working and just don't send the new fields). The demo shows plausible values for all of it.
- **Port alerts show up on the map screen (GitHub #22).** When an alert starts firing or a firing one
  clears, the map now pops it up live the way it does a device outage, so a port going down on a core
  link gets noticed without anyone sitting on the Alerts page. Only port-level alerts toast (device
  down already has its own popup), and it follows your alert policies, so if you only alert on uplinks
  that's all you'll see. The Alerts item in the nav has a red count of what's firing right now, and a
  port that's operationally down is marked "down" in the device panel's interface list. Restricted
  operators only hear about devices on their own maps.
- **Share the geo map on a public wallboard link (GitHub #37).** A wallboard link can now show the map's
  geographic view as well as (or instead of) the logical one - pick Map, Geo or Both when you create the
  link in Share wallboard, and change it later per link. A Both link gets a Map / Geo switcher in the page
  header (and remembers it as #geo / #map in the URL, so a TV reloads onto the same one). It's still no
  login and read only. A geo link hands out each device's drawn position on top of what the wallboard
  already showed, and only for that map's devices; no addresses, credentials or anything else. Existing
  links stay logical-only and show exactly what they did before.
- **OSPF costs and link toggles on the geo map (GitHub #22).** A map in geographic mode now shows the same
  per-end OSPF cost badges as the logical map, using your S/M/L size and colour choice (the OSPF button
  appears on the geo map too). New Links, Bandwidth and OSPF cost toggles in the top right let you strip
  the view back for planning, eg just the costs with no load labels. They're remembered per browser.
- **"Use SNMP location" for a hand-placed device (GitHub #22).** Once a device is dragged on the geo map
  or has coordinates typed in, it's a manual pin and its SNMP / RouterOS location stops moving it. Admins
  now get a "Use SNMP location" action in the device inspector and in both device editors that hands it
  back. We now remember the coordinates the location advertises even while a pin is manual, so if we
  already know them the device moves there straight away; if not, the manual flag is dropped and the
  next discovery pass places it.
- **Embed a public wallboard in an iframe (GitHub #15).** Settings -> Security has a new "Wallboard
  embedding" card where an admin lists the sites allowed to frame a shared wallboard link, eg your
  intranet or a Grafana/dashboard host, one `https://host[:port]` per line (a leading `*.` covers
  subdomains). It's empty by default so nothing changes until you add a site, and it can also be
  preset with `MYMATE_WALL_FRAME_ANCESTORS`. Only the `/wall/...` page itself gets relaxed; the
  console, the API and everything else still refuse to be framed. The list is global rather than per
  link on purpose: the link is already the key, and one list is easier to check and to empty fast.
  The public wallboard also no longer starts a session or sets any cookie, so it behaves the same
  in a third-party iframe and doesn't leave a throwaway session behind on every poll.
- **Custom background image on a map (GitHub #37).** Put a floor plan, site photo or rack diagram
  behind a map's devices: map menu -> "Background image", upload a PNG, JPEG, WebP or SVG (10 MB max
  by default, `MYMATE_MAP_BACKGROUND_MAX_KB`), then set its position, scale and opacity. It pans and
  zooms with the map, stays behind the devices and links, and shows on that map's public wallboard
  too. Replacing the image keeps your placement; Remove deletes it. Admin only to change, and it
  follows map permissions, so an operator who can't see a map can't fetch its image either. Files
  are checked by content, not name, and SVGs are cleaned on upload (script, event handlers, embedded
  HTML and anything pointing outside the file are stripped, DOCTYPEs refused) and always served
  sandboxed.
- **Long-term history, a year of graphs (GitHub #28).** Raw samples still keep full detail for the
  raw retention (14 days by default), but interface traffic, ping, device metrics, custom sensors and
  service probes are now also rolled up into 5 minute and hourly aggregates that are kept much longer:
  30 days of 5 minute and 400 days of hourly by default, each with its own setting in Settings -> Engine.
  Graphs and the inspector charts get 90 day, 180 day and 1 year ranges, and they pick the right source
  on their own - short windows read raw, longer ones the rollups, and a window that runs up to now
  stitches the rollups onto the latest raw samples so nothing goes missing at the join. Long ranges
  are also much quicker because they read one row per 5 minutes or hour instead of every poll. The
  rollups keep sums and counts, so averages stay exact at every zoom level, and they keep the peak too
  (a short burst still shows as the max in the data even on a year long graph). A new
  `mymate:history:rollup` command runs every 5 minutes from the scheduler; `--backfill` runs it until
  it's caught up in one go.

  *Upgrade notes:* the migration adds a BRIN index on `ts` to every raw samples table, built one
  partition at a time with `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` so polling isn't blocked, it takes about as long
  as reading the history tables once. After that the scheduler starts rolling up the raw history you
  already have, oldest first, a few minutes of work per run, so existing installs get their first
  weeks of long-term history without doing anything. As a guide, 1000 interfaces at a 60s poll backfill
  14 days in a minute or two; a 100k-interface install at 12s polls needs a couple of hours of
  background runs. Run `php artisan mymate:history:rollup --backfill` if you'd rather do it in one go.
  Disk: roughly 1.4 GB per 1000 interfaces for the 5 minute tier and 1.6 GB per 1000 interfaces for
  a full 400 days of hourly, growing to that over the retention period (see REQUIREMENTS.md). The
  scheduler (`schedule:work`, already part of every install) has to be running for rollups to happen;
  without it everything still reads raw like before.
- **Static objects: a device with no IP (GitHub #9, #28, #49).** Add a dumb switch, a patch panel, a
  building or an upstream you can't reach to the map and link real devices to it, like The Dude's static
  elements. It's a ping-only device with the IP left blank - there's a "Static" button next to Internet
  on the map toolbar. It is drawn and linked like any device (so a router port linked to it still shows
  that port's live traffic and status on the link) but it is never pinged, polled, probed, backed up or
  upgraded, and its card shows "static object" instead of a load bar. A device polled over SNMP or
  RouterOS still needs an IP. Static objects and their links survive map export and import.
- **Operator groups (GitHub #28).** Settings -> Operators now has a Groups card. A group has a name and
  is either read-only on all maps or restricted to the maps you tick (sub-maps come along), and you
  add operators to it from either the group or the operator form, so "NOC" or "Field techs - North"
  is set up once instead of per person. Someone's own per-user restriction still applies, and if any
  of their groups is restricted they're restricted too, seeing the maps from all of those combined -
  the most restrictive setting always wins. Admins are never in a group and always see everything.
  It's enforced server side the same way per-user restriction is. Groups are admin only, and a group
  that still has members can't be deleted (that would quietly give them the whole fleet). Nobody is
  in a group after upgrading, so existing access is unchanged.
- **The same IP can exist at more than one site (GitHub #49).** A management IP now only has to be
  unique within its poll scope - one remote agent, or the central server - instead of across the whole
  install, so 192.168.1.10 behind Site A's agent and 192.168.1.10 behind Site B's can both be added.
  This is the Dude-style setup where every site reuses the same private subnet. A genuine clash (same
  IP, same agent, including moving a device onto an agent that already polls that IP) is refused with a
  message naming the device it collides with. Removing an agent whose devices would clash with central
  ones once moved back to central polling is refused up front with the list, instead of failing.
- **Manage a device's parent straight from the map (GitHub #45).** Right-click any device card for a node
  menu: set, change or clear its parent device, take it off this map, or delete it outright. The
  inspector's Parent row is editable too - both open the same searchable picker, so you can re-home a
  device onto its real uplink without leaving the map. Parent is what drives dependency-aware alert
  suppression, downstream-first upgrade ordering, geo coordinate inheritance and the tree layouts, so
  fixing it on the map fixes all of those.
- **Delete a device from the map (GitHub #45).** Previously the map could only *hide* a device ("Remove
  from this map"); actually retiring one meant going to the Devices page. Both actions now sit side by
  side, clearly labelled, in the node menu and the inspector. Delete is admin-only and always confirms
  first - the dialog names the device and counts what goes with it (links, map placements, interfaces and
  history), and warns you when it has child devices, which survive with no parent.
- **Choose which interfaces raise an interface-down alert (GitHub #22).** An interface-down policy used
  to fire for every down port on the devices it covers, so a policy meant for uplinks also paged for
  every access port. The policy now has an Interfaces setting: every port (still the default, existing
  policies behave exactly as before), only ports that are one end of a map link, ports whose name or
  description matches a pattern like `sfp*, *uplink*`, or ports you pick by hand on the devices it's
  scoped to. A narrower policy still wins over a fleet-wide one for its devices, so "all devices, every
  port" plus "core routers, uplinks only" gives the core routers just their uplink alerts.
- **Low-throughput alerts on a single interface, eg a VLAN (GitHub #11).** Low throughput could only
  watch a link, so a VLAN or any port not drawn as a link couldn't be alerted on. A low-throughput policy
  can now watch interfaces instead, picked with the same Interfaces setting (by pattern like `vlan*`, by
  hand, or linked ports). It fires when the interface's busier direction drops under the floor while
  its device is up. It won't let you pick every port, that would alert on every idle port you have.
- **Run the remote agent on a MikroTik router (GitHub #38, #49).** Releases now include a small
  agent-only container image (about 7 MB) for amd64, arm64 and armv7, attached as `docker save`
  tarballs that RouterOS 7 can import with `/container/add file=...`. A site's own router can host the
  agent Dude-style, no extra box needed. It's configured with the usual `MYMATE_*` env vars and keeps
  no state, so there's nothing to mount. Step by step setup is in `agent/ROUTEROS.md`. The RouterOS
  steps follow MikroTik's container docs and haven't been tried on real router hardware yet, so
  feedback is welcome. The same image runs on any Docker or podman host.
- **Ping source address per device (GitHub #11).** v1.4.0 only had the global `MYMATE_PING_SOURCE`, which
  applied to every device - the "per-device" wording there was wrong. Now you can set a ping source
  address on any device in its edit dialog, so eg a customer-facing router is pinged from its customer
  interface to prove that path reaches out. The global env var is still the default for devices that
  dont set one. The central sweep runs one fping per distinct source (still a single fping when nobody
  sets one). Agent-polled devices honour it too, the agent binds its ICMP socket to that address, so
  agents need updating for it to take effect (an older agent just ignores it and pings from its default
  route). A source that isnt a local address on the server/agent makes the ping fail, so it shows down.
- **Fibre optical Tx/Rx power, with an alert (GitHub #11).** SFP ports now show their optical receive and
  transmit power in dBm under the port in the device inspector's interface list. Read on the metrics poll
  from MikroTik, over the RouterOS API (`/interface/ethernet/monitor`) or over SNMP (MIKROTIK-MIB
  optical table). Other vendors can be added through the SNMP metrics profile in config when their optical
  table is keyed by ifIndex; none are wired in yet. New alert condition "Fibre optical power" fires per port
  when Rx or Tx goes below (or above) a dBm threshold you set, default Rx below -25 dBm, with the usual
  scoping and sustained-duration options. Pulling a module clears its reading. Agent-polled devices need
  the agent updated to report optical power; older agents keep working, they just don't send it.
- **The device page is live.** Port state, packet / error / discard rates and optical power update on the
  Ports tab, the port page and the map inspector's port list as they're polled, and a port going down
  flips its chip straight away. Uptime and per-processor load tick on the Overview, which also gets a
  Processors and a Storage card (storage refreshes whenever the metrics poll reads it). Normally only
  ports that are one end of a link are pushed live, to keep the websocket small on a big fleet; while a
  device page or the inspector has a device open, all of that device's ports are sent. When a device
  reboots the map pops "sw1 rebooted (was up 41d 3h)" (a batch of them becomes one "12 devices
  rebooted"), and an open device page adds it to its Events tab. Restricted operators only get their own
  devices, as with everything else live. Graphs on a live range keep refreshing once a minute as before.
- **Firmware upgrade history.** Every RouterOS upgrade attempt is now kept, not just the last one, with
  the version it went from and to, how long it took, who started it and whether it was part of a bulk
  run. The device page Events tab lists each one ("Upgraded 7.14 -> 7.15.2 (took 3m 3s)", "Upgrade
  failed: Did not come back online after reboot") and the Overview shows the last upgrade. The
  outcome each device already had is carried over when you update, so the history doesn't start empty.
  A run that died half way (worker killed mid reboot) gets closed off as interrupted when the next one
  starts.
- **Wireless stats for RouterOS 7 wifi (cAP ax, hAP ax2/ax3, wAP ax and friends).** Signal and client
  count now come from the new wifi registration table (7.13+) or wifiwave2 (7.12 and older) as well as
  the old wireless package, over the RouterOS API both centrally and from a remote agent. A CAPsMAN
  controller reports every client across its CAPs (wifi or legacy CAPsMAN), each station counted once.
  The wifi stack has no CCQ or SNR, so those stay blank rather than being guessed. Which menus a board
  has is worked out once per RouterOS version, so a normal poll doesn't try all of them. Over SNMP the
  MikroTik profile now also walks the wifi registration table (mtxrWifiRegistrationTable), which gives
  signal and clients on newer 7.x; wifiwave2 and wifi CAPsMAN clients still need the API.

### Changed
- **Graph PNG export includes the legend.** Exporting a device page graph as PNG now gives you the
  title, the device and time range, the chart and the min / avg / max / last / 95th table in one image
  at 2x, instead of just the lines.
- **Live port updates are smaller.** Each interface in the per-tick util update no longer repeats its
  device id and status, util is sent to two decimal places and bps as whole bits. A 48 port switch's
  frame is about 40% smaller on an ordinary tick (8.9 KB down to 5.4 KB), and the new port fields are
  only sent when they change.
- **`GET /api/devices` is now paginated (GitHub #22). API change.** It used to return the whole fleet
  in one go, which at ~25,000 devices was a 36 MB response that ran php-fpm out of memory. It now
  returns one page in Laravel's usual `data` / `links` / `meta` shape, 50 per page by default and at
  most 200 (`?per_page=`, `?page=`). You can search with `?q=` (name, IP, vendor, model), filter with
  `?status=`, `?device_type=`, `?poll_method=`, `?monitored=`, `?placed=`, `?map_id=`, `?ids[]=` and a
  few others, and sort with `?sort=name|status|mgmt_ip|last_change|vendor|model` (prefix `-` to
  reverse; `status` puts down first). `?fields=summary` gives a lean row for pickers. **If you have a
  script that reads `/api/devices`, it now only sees the first 50 devices** - walk `meta.last_page` or
  follow `links.next` to get the rest. New alongside it: `GET /api/devices/stats` (up/down/unknown and
  paused counts) and `GET /api/maps/{id}/devices` (every device on one map). `GET /api/devices/{id}`
  was already there and now also resolves coordinates inherited from the uplink chain.
- **The console no longer loads every device up front (GitHub #22).** Each screen asks for what it
  shows: the map pulls only the devices on the open map, the device panel fetches the one you clicked,
  the header counts come from the new stats endpoint, and the Devices page searches, filters, sorts and
  pages on the server (50 at a time), so it stays quick at tens of thousands of devices. The parent,
  far-end-of-link, graph, sensor test and alert "specific devices" pickers are now search-as-you-type,
  as are the map's "add a device" palette and the Upgrades and Backups lists (with "show more"). The
  geo overlay draws from the compact geo feed and lists unplaced devices 200 at a time. Live status,
  latency and CPU/memory updates reach all of these the same as before.
- **Map links show traffic both ways (GitHub #22).** The label on a link used to show only the busier
  direction. It now shows each direction's rate with a small arrow pointing the way that traffic is
  going along the wire (so you can read tx and rx at a glance whichever way the cards are laid out),
  followed by the link speed and utilisation. Same on the geo map and the wallboard.
- **"Sustained for" is on every alert condition it applies to (GitHub #22).** The delay was only in the
  form for device down, high utilisation and high metric, though the engine already honoured it for
  everything. It's now there for interface down, low throughput, service probes and remote agents too.
  Set it to a couple of minutes on an interface-down policy and a flapping port stops sending you
  down/up pairs, it has to stay down that long before you hear about it.

### Fixed
- **Live views clear values that go away.** A port rate that stops (a counter reset) or an SFP that is
  pulled now clears on an open device page or inspector straight away, instead of showing the last
  value until the page is reloaded. The Ports tab's Errors column is also live now (errors plus discards
  per second), rather than the last hour's history.
- **A wired MikroTik polled over the API no longer shows 1 wireless client.** The "no such command"
  reply for a missing wireless menu was being counted as a registration table row.
- **No traffic spike when a switch's 64-bit counters drop out for a poll.** A v2c device that briefly
  stopped answering the 64-bit octet counters fell back to the 32-bit ones, and the tick they came back
  compared a 32-bit reading against a 64-bit one and drew a spike of tens of Gbps. The poller now
  remembers which width it read last and skips the rate for that one tick.
- **Large maps load device photos once per model, not once per device.** A map with 500 of the same
  MikroTik made 500 separate photo requests; they now share one cached image per model (the wallboard
  too). Opening a map with many cross-map links also no longer runs two database queries per link.
- **Large fleets: maps no longer download every link, and the geo map loads fast (GitHub #22).** The
  map, geo map and device panel used to fetch every link in the install with its interface data, which
  at 25k devices is the next payload that falls over after the device list. They now ask only for the
  links on the map being viewed, or touching the device being looked at. `GET /api/links` still returns
  everything when called with no filter, and takes `?map_id=` or `?device_id=`. The geo map's device
  feed went from 2.3s and 270 MB of server memory to about 140ms and 46 MB at 25k devices.
- **Graph axes no longer read "250 undefined" on an empty or near-zero traffic chart.** Rates under
  1 bps picked a unit that doesn't exist. Showed up on every device page graph while it loaded.
- **Asymmetric links show both speeds.** A 500/50 radio link used to label itself "/500M" and then show
  the upload direction at several hundred percent. The label now reads "/500M/50M", in the same order as
  the direction arrows.
- **Demo: devices sit around Brisbane and show as live.** The demo network now has real coordinates
  (so the geo map, geo playback and "Use SNMP location" all have something to show), the header counts
  and geo map include its devices instead of reading 0 up / 0 down, and the simulated traffic on the
  asymmetric radio link stays within its 50M upload.
- **SNMPv1 devices get traffic and packet graphs (airOS and other v1-only gear).** v1 can't carry the
  64-bit counters we read, so a v1 device showed no traffic and no packets at all. It now reads the
  32-bit ifTable counters instead (ifInOctets / ifOutOctets, and unicast + non-unicast packets), with the
  counter wrap handled so a busy port doesn't lose a sample every few minutes. A v2c or v3 port that
  doesn't answer the 64-bit packet counters falls back the same way. Works centrally and from a remote
  agent (update the agent to pick it up).
- **Remote agents collect wireless RF.** Devices polled by an agent now get signal, SNR, CCQ and the
  client count like centrally polled ones: the vendor SNMP OIDs (MikroTik, Ubiquiti airMAX, Cambium ePMP)
  and the RouterOS wireless registration table. They land on the map tile, the device page Wireless
  graphs and the history. Before this an agent-polled radio never showed any RF. Needs the updated agent,
  an older one keeps working and just leaves the RF alone.
- **Live cpu / memory / temperature on bigger fleets.** A metrics poll sent its whole shard as one
  websocket message, which past a few dozen devices was over Reverb's 10 KB limit and was dropped, so the
  map tiles only moved on a refetch. It's now split to fit, the same as the port updates. Agent-polled
  port updates are split the same way.
- **Large fleets: header counts, the map inspector and the Devices page work again (GitHub #22).** On a
  network of ~25,000 devices the header showed "0 up / 0 down", clicking a device on the map did nothing
  and the Devices page hung the tab, all because the one fleet-wide device request never finished. See
  the paginated `/api/devices` change above.
- **A public wallboard link no longer hands out links that leave the shared map.** A link with only one
  end on the map was included in the wallboard's link data even though it was never drawn, which gave an
  anonymous viewer the far device's id and that port's name and traffic. Only links with both ends on the
  shared map are sent now.
- **Saving a device no longer turns its SNMP-placed pin into a manual one (GitHub #22).** The device
  editors send the coordinates back on every save, which marked the location manual even when nothing
  about it changed, so a simple rename stopped the SNMP location from ever moving the device again. Only
  an actual change of coordinates counts as a manual pin now.
- **Device total throughput on 24h and longer charts was inflated.** The inspector's device-wide chart
  summed every sample in a bucket, so once a bucket held several polls per interface (anything past
  about an hour) the total was multiplied by the number of polls in it. It now averages each interface
  over the bucket and then adds them up.
- **Restricted operators no longer receive live updates for devices outside their maps.** The live
  map's websocket channel carried the whole fleet and let any signed-in user subscribe, so a
  map-restricted operator (per-user or through a group) was sent live status, traffic and metrics for
  devices they can't otherwise see - hidden by the UI, but readable off the socket. The shared channel
  is now for unrestricted operators only, and a restricted operator gets their own channel carrying
  just their devices. Nothing to configure; their live map works as before.
- **A device found by an agent's discovery sweep is now polled by that agent.** Discovery candidates
  never recorded which agent found them, so approving one created a *central* device the server usually
  had no route to (it sits on the remote site's network) and it just showed down. Candidates now carry
  their agent, approving one assigns the device to it, and the discovery queue shows "via agent X".
  Existing queued candidates are matched to their agent by subnet on upgrade. Devices already approved
  this way keep their current setting - set the Agent on them if they're showing down.
- **Docker images now bundle the intended backup engine (GitHub #41).** The image cloned rusted's moving
  `main` in a cached build layer, so every 1.7.x Docker image silently shipped an old engine without
  the MikroTik exec-channel fix, and MikroTik backups kept failing with "captured empty configuration"
  on Docker even though the .deb/LXC were fine. The Docker build and `build-rusted.sh` now clone one
  pinned rusted release (`deploy/rusted/VERSION`), so all three packages bundle the same engine and
  bumping the pin always rebuilds it. (1.8.0's image happened to pick up a fresh clone and is unaffected.)
- **Site markers on the geo map no longer time out on a large fleet (GitHub #47).** `devices.site_id`
  was a constrained foreign key with no index, and Postgres does not index those for you, so the
  per-site device and down counts behind `GET /api/sites` scanned the whole devices table once per
  site. On a 25,423-device, 2,722-site fleet that was 61 s per call, tripping a 120 s reverse-proxy
  timeout about two thirds of the time and leaving the map empty after login. A `(site_id, status)`
  index covers both counts and takes the same call to 0.2 s.
- **A burst of status flips no longer hammers the outage timeline (GitHub #47).** Every up/down flip
  invalidated the outage queries the moment it arrived. During weather a large fleet sees several
  hundred flips a minute, which turned each open browser tab into a ~100 req/s client of
  `/api/outages` - around 850k requests an hour from two tabs, starving php-fpm of the requests that
  actually draw the map. The refresh is now coalesced to at most one call per 5 s window, still
  trailing-edge so the last flip in a burst is reflected.
- **A parent loop can no longer be created (GitHub #45).** Setting a device's parent to one of its own
  downstream devices (A under B under A) is now refused with a clear message instead of being saved.
  A loop would quietly break alert suppression, upgrade ordering and inherited map coordinates.
- **Confirmation dialogs opened from the device inspector are no longer squeezed into it.** The
  inspector pane is a blurred, sliding panel, which trapped any dialog rendered inside it - so
  "Delete link" and the RouterOS upgrade confirmation appeared cramped into the 22rem column
  instead of centred on screen. They now centre properly, like every other dialog.
- **The map no longer draws a deleted device's links (GitHub #45).** Deleting a device removes its links
  and map placements in the database, but the map kept its edges and inter-map portals on screen until
  the next refresh. Both caches now refresh with the delete.
- **Remote agents running as root no longer mark down hosts as up.** When the agent can't get an
  unprivileged ping socket (typical as root in a container, or when `ping_group_range` excludes it) it
  falls back to a raw ICMP socket, and a raw socket sees every echo reply on the box. Any reply was
  taken as "mine", so while one host answered, every other ping running at the same time counted as
  up too, which also made discovery sweeps report phantom devices. Replies are now matched on sender,
  id and sequence. If the agent can't open any ICMP socket at all it now says so once in its log
  instead of quietly showing everything down.
- **Services no longer give up after a few fast crashes.** Supervisor's defaults (3 retries, 1s to
  count as started) turned a short startup failure, like the database not being ready yet, into a
  permanent FATAL until someone restarted it by hand. That's how the demo simulator stayed dead for
  five weeks (GitHub #48). The supervisor configs (`deploy/supervisor/` and the Docker image) now use
  `startsecs=10` and `startretries=1000`, so they keep retrying with a growing backoff. The packaged
  systemd units get `StartLimitIntervalSec=0` for the same reason. If you copied
  `deploy/supervisor/mymate.conf` into `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/`, copy it again and run
  `supervisorctl reread && supervisorctl update`.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **Add a device without putting it on a map (GitHub #43).** Both add-device forms (the Devices page and the
  map toolbar) gain a "Place on … map" checkbox, on by default. Untick it for gear you want
  monitored but not cluttering the canvas - a batch of client CPE, say. Adding from the map
  toolbar now places the device exactly once, on the map you're looking at (it used to also
  land a copy on the default map when that wasn't the active one).
- **Bulk "Remove from maps" on the Devices page (GitHub #43).** Select any devices and take them off every
  map in one go; they stay monitored and keep their links and history, and any of them can be
  re-added from a map's inspector. The list also gains an "Any map / On a map / Not on any map"
  filter and a "Not on any map" tag so hidden devices are easy to find. Note that an operator
  restricted to specific maps cannot see a device that is on no map at all.
- **Expandable health history (GitHub #43).** The inspector's Health section gets the same expand arrow as
  Total throughput: a large chart of one metric at a time - latency, loss, jitter, CPU, memory,
  temperature, signal, SNR, CCQ, wireless clients, OSPF neighbours - with a real labelled axis
  in that metric's unit and 1h to 30d ranges. Works for ping-only devices too.

### Fixed
- **Inspector icon sometimes blank.** Opening a non-MikroTik device (a Grandstream switch, say) straight after a
  MikroTik one left an empty box where the vendor mark or device icon belongs. The glyph now resets when the
  device under it changes, so the mark / icon always shows.
- **Group drags on the map now save every device (GitHub #44).** Selecting several devices and dragging them
  together only persisted the one under the cursor; the rest snapped back to their old spots on the
  next refresh, which looked like the map "forgetting" positions after a big batch of adds. All the
  dragged nodes (devices, portals, child maps and notes) now go up in one request, Tidy saves the
  whole layout in one request too, and a device dropped onto the canvas lands at its drop point in
  the same call that adds it - no follow-up save to race against a refresh. A failed save now shows a
  toast and reverts the nodes instead of silently disagreeing with the server, and a refresh mid-drag
  no longer bounces nodes back. Selection survives a canvas rebuild, so a group stays selected after
  you move it. Same one-node fix for group drags on the Geo map.
- **Dead portal stubs on the map (GitHub #43).** A link to a device that isn't on any map no longer draws a
  greyed-out "other map" portal that leads nowhere - on the canvas or the public wallboard. So
  hiding a client device from the map now actually hides it, link and all.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Custom SNMP sensors: test an OID + show readings on the device face (GitHub #40).** The sensor
  form has a "Test OID" button that reads the OID against a chosen device (exactly as the poller
  will) so you can confirm it returns a value before saving. And a sensor can be flagged "Show on
  device face" to draw its current reading as a Dude-style label on the device's map card (e.g.
  "22°C Temp"); multiple face sensors stack on the card.

### Fixed
- **Link editing (GitHub #39).** A link's media type is now editable, not just settable at creation
  (the Edit tab of a link gained the media-type picker). And the link edit / add-link dialogs opened
  from the device inspector now render as a proper centred modal instead of being trapped inside the
  narrow inspector pane (they're portalled out past the pane's transform/blur).

### Changed
- **Backup failures now show why, on the Backups page.** A failed device lists the engine's actual
  message (e.g. "captured empty configuration") inline instead of just a red dot, and the reason is
  surfaced even when the backup engine reports the failure via an HTTP error status rather than in a
  200 body - so a device shows the specific cause rather than a generic failure.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-08-28

### Security
- **Fixed a passkey 2FA bypass (GitHub #42).** The enforcement gate allowlisted `passkeys.*`, which
  matched the register and delete routes as well as the verify ceremony, and registering a passkey
  marked the session verified. Together, someone who knew only an operator's password could log in,
  enrol their own authenticator to satisfy the gate, and delete the victim's passkey - defeating the
  second factor. The gate now only lets an unverified session reach the verify ceremony (always) and
  register a *first* passkey when the operator has none yet; an operator who already has a passkey
  must verify it, never mint a new one or delete one, until verified. Anyone with passkeys enabled
  (fleet-mandatory or opt-in 2FA) should update. Thanks to @appelboom for the report.

### Fixed
- Graph PNG export failed under the app's Content-Security-Policy (it rasterised through a `blob:`
  image, which `img-src` doesn't allow). It now loads through a `data:` URL instead. SVG and CSV
  export were unaffected.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Graph styling.** Custom graphs can now be drawn as filled areas or stacked (same-scale series
  pile up to their combined total), each series takes its own line/fill colour and a custom name, and
  a colour mode chooses whether an interface's in + out share a colour (out dashed) or every series
  gets its own. Settings → Graphs sets the house default for fill/stacking/colour-mode plus a
  series-colour palette of any length (assigned in order, wrapping when a graph has more series than
  colours); graphs override those per-graph. Gridlines and the total line now use theme-aware ink,
  so they stay legible in light mode instead of washing out to invisible white.
- **Latency from remote agents.** Agents now measure round-trip time, loss and jitter (not just
  up/down) and the server folds them into the same trend + live tiles central polling uses, so a
  device monitored through an agent shows latency graphs like any other. Agent up/down also gets the
  same flap dampening as the central sweep. (Agents must be updated to the new build to report it.)
- **Agents page shows version + latency.** Settings → Agents now lists each agent's version and its
  current link latency (measured from the hub keepalive), with an "update" badge when an agent is
  behind the server version.
- **Map note styling.** Notes take a text colour, background colour and size (S/M/L) from a toolbar
  on the selected note. Their default colours are now theme-aware, so an unstyled note reads on the
  light theme instead of showing as invisible white-on-white.
- **Export a graph.** Any custom graph can be saved as a PNG or SVG image, or a CSV of its
  time/value points, from an export menu on the graph.

### Security
- Bumped guzzlehttp/guzzle (7.12.3 -> 7.15.3) and league/commonmark (2.8.2 -> 2.10.0) past a run of
  2026 CVEs. Both are transitive via Laravel, not app code; updated within Laravel's constraints.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Passkeys (WebAuthn) with an optional mandatory mode.** Operators can register a passkey
  (fingerprint / face / security key) as a phishing-resistant second factor from Settings → Account.
  An admin can flip Settings → Security to require them fleet-wide: everyone without one is forced to
  enrol at their next action, and existing sessions are bounced (with a warning first, and a
  per-operator "exclude from mandatory passkey" for wallboard/kiosk accounts that can't do WebAuthn).
  API keys are never affected. Needs HTTPS (WebAuthn only runs on a secure origin).
- **Agent up/down alerting.** A new "Remote agent offline" alert condition fires when an agent stops
  heart-beating. Because its devices go dark when it does, their individual down alerts roll up into
  the one agent-down alert (gated on the existing suppress-dependent knob) - so you get one clear
  page naming how many devices are behind it, not a storm or a silent gap.
- **Dependency tidy + always-undoable layouts.** A new "Dependency (from selected)" tidy: pick a
  device and only its downstream branch is re-laid-out as a clean tree fanning south, with the
  selected device left exactly where it is and everything north/unrelated untouched - so you can add
  gear under a switch later and re-tidy just that branch. With nothing selected it tidies the whole
  map from the north-most device. Every tidy now snapshots the previous layout **server-side first**,
  so there's an **Undo tidy** button that rolls back from any browser - which is why the old "this
  can't be undone" confirmation is gone.
- **Links tidy themselves up (auto-attach).** A toolbar toggle lets a link's ends float to whichever
  side of each card faces the other, re-picking as you drag cards around, so the map stops looking
  like a plate of spaghetti. On by default. Flip it to "pinned" and you can drag a link's endpoint
  onto any side of a card to fix it there. Works for device links and the device-less overview links.
- **API reference on the demo site.** A full, interactive OpenAPI 3.1 reference (rendered with
  Scalar) covering the integration API - devices, interfaces, maps, links, sites, alerts, backups,
  graphs and more - with the bearer API-key auth documented. Served at `/api-docs`, surfaced only on
  the sales/demo instance and linked from its chrome; a real monitoring instance 404s it.

### Fixed
- **HTTPS setup no longer needs `sudo`.** The self-signed cert step shelled out via `sudo -u`, but
  `sudo` isn't a package dependency and is often absent on a minimal box - so it aborted mid-install
  (behind a generic "serving plain HTTP" warning) and left `APP_URL` on http, which in turn broke
  passkeys and secure cookies. It now drops privileges with `runuser` like the rest of the installer.
- **A dead session bounces to the login screen instead of erroring.** An expired session used to
  spray sticky red toasts from every in-flight request; now it drops cleanly to the login screen with
  a single "your session ended" notice.
- **Big maps stay responsive.** On a large map the device cards were re-rendering on every poll and
  util tick, so the canvas janked and clicks felt dead until stats settled. Only the cards that
  actually changed re-render now.
- **Graphs: latency overlaid on traffic keeps a sensible scale.** Adding a ping/probe latency series
  to an interface-throughput graph used to drop the axis to raw bits and flatten the latency line to
  zero. Traffic now drives the left axis in kbps/Mbps, and latency rides its own right-hand ms axis.
- **RouterOS upgrades: CHR fetches the right package.** A CHR reports its architecture as `x86_64`, so
  the cache tried `routeros-<v>-x86_64.npk`, which doesn't exist on MikroTik and 404'd. RouterOS 7
  serves x86 and CHR from a single arch-less `routeros-<v>.npk`; we now use that for both.
- **Backup engine auto-provisioning no longer fails as root.** The rusted provision script left a
  dangling `-u` when `$SUDO` was empty (running as root), so backup setup bailed with a shell error.
  It now drops to the app user with `runuser`. The engine was installed fine - only the wiring step
  was skipped.
- **Light mode: pale button/toggle text is readable.** The Cache button, the Discovery/Dashboard
  toggles, the icon picker and a few others used a light `-200` tint text that washed out on white;
  it's darkened in light mode now.
- **Sensors: the "walk a table" row no longer collapses.** Choosing the walk aggregation squeezed the
  mode select down to just its caret; the two selects now share the row evenly.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Remote agents now do the whole job (GitHub #33).** An agent in a customer or out-of-band
  network no longer just relays pings - interface discovery, fact capture (vendor/model/serial/
  uptime), service probes and RouterOS device discovery all run *from* the agent and stream back
  over its outbound tunnel, so a device reachable only from the far side is monitored exactly like
  a central one. Assign a device to an agent on the device form and every poll type follows it.
- **Personal API keys.** Mint a bearer token from Settings for scripts, dashboards and
  integrations. The key authenticates as you through the same guard the web app uses, so it
  carries your exact access - an admin's key can write, a read-only operator's key stays
  read-only, a map-restricted operator's key only sees their maps. The token is shown once on
  creation; revoke it any time.
- **Light / dark mode toggle (GitHub #34).** A theme switch in the top bar, remembered across
  reloads, applied everywhere including the topology and wallboard canvases. Defaults to the
  dark theme you already had.
- **Sites: place a whole tower at once.** A site (tower, fiber cabinet, POP) carries coordinates
  once and every device at it inherits them on the geo map, so a few thousand devices on a few
  hundred towers no longer means dragging a few thousand pins. The site slots into the same
  coordinate resolution as uplink inheritance: own pin, else site, else uplink ancestor. Sites
  import from a plain CSV (`php artisan mymate:sites:import`) keyed on an `external_ref` from
  whatever inventory owns the truth, so a scheduled re-sync corrects coordinates in place;
  devices are placed either from an authoritative `mgmt_ip,external_ref` mapping or by snapping
  unplaced devices to the nearest site, and neither pass ever overwrites a placement an operator
  made by hand. Manage them at `/api/sites`, or assign one device from the device editor.
- **Geo map: the whole fleet renders smoothly.** Device markers now cluster into count-bubbles
  that split apart as you zoom, and the map has compact purpose-built feeds (`/geo/devices`,
  `/geo/backhauls`) so plotting a dot no longer means pulling the full multi-megabyte device
  payload.
- **Geo map: backhaul lines.** Site-to-site links (imported alongside sites) draw as solid fiber /
  dashed wireless lines under the markers, so the map shows the real backbone instead of leaving
  you to infer it.
- **Geo map: layer toggles.** Devices and backhauls each have a switch on the map, remembered
  across reloads (both start on).

### Changed
- **Settings moved to a tabbed layout.** The page had grown into one long scroll of stacked
  cards; each concern is now its own tab (Account, Engine, Mail, Backups, Credentials, Sensors,
  Operators, Agents, System). Read-only operators see just Account, the rosters and their API
  keys. Nothing was removed, only reorganised.
- **A map can set its own up/down ping interval.** Override the global cadence per map, so a
  latency-sensitive core map can poll faster than a large access map without changing the whole
  fleet.

### Fixed
- **`ping`/`mtr` are Recommends, not hard Depends.** They only power the Tools traceroute/ping,
  so a bare `dpkg -i` no longer fails when they're absent - it installs and those two tools are
  simply unavailable until added. `apt install ./mymate.deb` still pulls them automatically.
- **Interface descriptions show in the device inspector.** The operator-set port description
  (SNMP ifAlias / RouterOS comment) was captured, stored and searchable, but the inspector's
  interface list only ever rendered the port name, so all that context was invisible. It now
  shows under the port name when set.
- **Add/Edit device dialog is reachable on shorter screens.** The dialog had no height cap, so a
  tall device form (SNMP credential + location + icon grid + colours) ran off the bottom of the
  viewport with no way to scroll, leaving the Save button unreachable. It now caps at 85% of the
  screen height and scrolls. The link-history dialog got the same guard.
- **Graphs render in local time, not UTC (GitHub #36).** History timestamps came off the bucketed
  query without a zone marker, so charts plotted an hour axis several hours out from the wall
  clock the rest of the UI showed. They now convert to the browser's local time to match.
- **Light mode: the map and pale chips are readable.** The topology and wallboard canvases stayed
  black in light mode, muted body text was too faint on white, and the pale status chips
  (up/down counters, the Operational badge) washed out. The canvases now follow the theme, muted
  text was firmed up, and the chip text darkens on the light surface.
- **Alerts carry the device IP, and the global policy stops double-notifying.** A device covered
  by both a per-map policy and the catch-all global policy fired two notifications per event; the
  global policy now yields to a more specific one. Alert payloads also include the management IP
  so a notification says which box, not just its name.
- **Map: device up/down toasts no longer pile up.** Down toasts were sticky (meant for error
  messages), so a flapping device stacked a fresh "X is down" notification every cycle and the
  pile grew for as long as the page stayed open. Status toasts now auto-dismiss after 10 seconds,
  a repeat flip from the same device replaces its existing toast instead of adding another, and
  the stack is capped at six with the oldest dropped first. Error toasts still stay until
  dismissed.
- **Outages timeline refreshes the instant a device flips**, instead of waiting for the next
  periodic refetch to show the change.
- **RouterOS reads a port's up/down state before its throughput**, so a port that's down is
  reported down even when the throughput read for it fails.
- **The package pulls in `ping` and `mtr`** so the Tools page (and path trace) work on a clean
  install without a manual apt step.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **Tools page: standalone network diagnostics.** A new Tools page in the nav with six utilities
  that run from the My Mate server, aimed at a target you type rather than a monitored device:
  ping, traceroute (MTR), an IPv4 subnet scan (a live-host sweep that adds reverse DNS, a NetBIOS
  name/MAC, and an optional port scan per host), a port map (TCP connect scan of a target), an
  IPv4/IPv6 subnet calculator, and a bgp.tools lookup (origin AS, name and covering prefix for an
  IP or ASN). The scanning tools are pure PHP plus the fping already on the box - no nmap or other
  new dependencies - and they stream results live with a Stop button; navigating away cancels the
  run. Available to every operator as read-only diagnostics, and they share the isolated `trace`
  Horizon queue so a scan never delays a ping or poll sweep.
- **Graphs page: custom multi-interface charts (GitHub #28).** A new Graphs page where you build
  and save charts plotting any number of interfaces together - inbound and/or outbound - with an
  optional combined total line, over a selectable time range, as throughput or utilisation. Handy
  for watching several internet links and their combined usage on one chart.
- **Live path trace to a device.** A Trace button on the device inspector runs an MTR-style trace
  from the My Mate server to the device's management IP and fills a live hop table - loss %,
  probes sent, last/avg/best/worst/stdev latency, reverse-DNS names, colour-coded loss and a
  latency bar - updating once a second until it finishes or you stop it. It answers "where does
  it break?", not just "is it down?". Every operator can run one (read-only accounts included):
  the target is always the device's own IP, so there is nothing to point somewhere else. Traces
  run on their own `trace` Horizon queue, so a long one never delays a ping or poll sweep, and
  closing the modal kills the mtr process. Needs the `mtr` binary on the box (Debian:
  `apt-get install mtr-tiny`); the Docker image ships it.
- **Granular access: restrict operators to specific maps (GitHub #28).** On top of the admin /
  read-only split, an operator can now be marked "restricted" and granted specific maps. They then
  see only those maps (and their sub-maps) and the devices and links on them - everything else,
  including the fleet-wide tools, is hidden. Set it per operator under Settings -> Operators. Useful
  for giving a customer or a colleague a limited view without exposing the rest of the network.
  Admins and ordinary viewers are unaffected, and nobody is restricted by default.
- **Service probes: HTTP/TCP checks for non-SNMP devices (GitHub #19).** My Mate's take on The
  Dude's custom probes. Attach an HTTP(S) or TCP check to a device to monitor a service that speaks
  neither SNMP nor the RouterOS API - a web UI, an API endpoint, a port. HTTP probes decide up/down
  from the status code (ranges/lists/`2xx` wildcards) and an optional body keyword, time the round
  trip, and for HTTPS also report the TLS certificate expiry (so a probe doubles as a cert watch).
  TCP probes just open the port. Probes run on the poll loop with the same flap dampening as ping,
  keep a latency/status history, and feed a new "service probe down" alert condition. Managed from
  the device inspector, with a run-now test button.
- **Geo map: devices inherit their uplink's location (GitHub #21).** A device with no coordinates
  of its own now falls back to the nearest ancestor up its uplink (parent) chain, so CPE behind a
  placed tower or AP appear on the geographic map automatically without geocoding every endpoint.
- **Sales demo: charts are full from the first click.** `mymate:demo --seed` now backfills 24 hours
  of per-minute history for every mock device - throughput, CPU/memory/temperature, and ping
  latency/loss/jitter - so the device inspector never shows "No history yet" on the demo. The
  backfill uses the same generators as the live simulator (both keyed on wall-clock time), so the
  simulator's live samples continue the backfilled series without a visible seam.
- **Sales demo: synthetic ping data.** The simulator now records latency/loss/jitter each tick
  (down devices report 100% loss and no RTT, mirroring the real ping loop), so the inspector's
  Latency and Loss sparklines are populated and live-update. See [deploy/demo/README.md](deploy/demo/README.md).

### Fixed
- **Trace now shows the first hop.** mtr's raw output numbers hops from zero, and index 0 is the
  first real hop (the local gateway), not the source - the parser was dropping it, so both the
  device trace and the new Tools traceroute started at the second hop. The first hop is now kept,
  and hops are numbered from 1 like traceroute.
- **Redis no longer grows until it gets OOM-killed on large fleets.** The live map updates
  (interface load, device metrics, up/down, latency) were queued for delivery; on a big fleet the
  per-tick stream out-ran the worker draining it and piled up in Redis until the kernel killed
  `redis-server` and took monitoring down with it. These ephemeral updates now broadcast inline, so
  they never touch the queue - a delayed frame is stale anyway. As a backstop the packaged installs
  now cap Redis memory (`maxmemory` at 40% of RAM, `allkeys-lru`), and Horizon keeps far less
  completed-job history and ignores the routine poll jobs entirely. Nothing here is durable, so the
  cap and the shorter history are safe. Apply the cap to an existing box now with
  `redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory <~40% of RAM>` and `redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`.
- **Ping monitoring survives the sharding upgrade.** After deploying the sharded ping sweep
  (1.4.0), a still-running pre-upgrade dispatcher (`mymate:loop`) kept queueing old-format
  sweep jobs whose payloads lack the new shard fields - deserialisation skips the constructor,
  so every sweep crashed on an uninitialised property and up/down status, live latency, and
  ping history all silently froze until the daemons were restarted. Old-format jobs now fall
  back to a whole-fleet sweep. (As always, restart `mymate-loop`/Horizon after upgrading.)
- **Sharded sweeps record complete latency history.** With `ping.shards` > 1, the latency
  history write-throttle was global, so only the first shard to sweep each interval recorded
  history - devices in other shards got sparse, random samples. The throttle is now per shard.
- **Dropdown options are readable on a light-mode OS.** Every native select popup (Add device's
  poll method/type/agent, list filters, settings, and so on) could render as a white list with
  invisible white text when the browser/OS runs in light mode - the options inherited the app's
  translucent control background, which popup surfaces can't composite. Options now get an
  explicit solid dark surface, app-wide.
- **Geo map no longer opens on an empty world view.** On the first visit, the geographic map
  could show a fully zoomed-out world with no device pins (working only on the second open):
  the Leaflet map is created once the map config loads, but the pin-drawing and
  fit-to-devices steps only reacted to the device list - which was usually already cached -
  so they had run (and done nothing) before the map existed. They now also re-run when the
  map is created, so the first open drops the pins and zooms to them like every later open.
- **Sales demo: history no longer silently goes stale.** The demo simulator created history
  partitions only once at startup, so once the daemon outlived the create-ahead window (a few
  days) every history insert failed silently and the charts froze. History inserts now roll the
  partitions forward and retry when they hit a missing partition, so a long-running simulator
  keeps recording indefinitely.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Anonymous wallboard links (GitHub #15).** Share a map's live wallboard as a read-only, no-login
  link for a NOC screen or a status page. On any map, open the map menu and pick "Share wallboard"
  to mint an unguessable link; turn it off or remove it to revoke access at any time. The public
  view is read-only, polls for live status and link load, and never shows management addresses or
  credentials - only what the map draws.
- **Windows remote agent (GitHub #14).** The agent now builds for Windows (amd64 / arm64) and can
  install itself as a Windows service: `mymate-agent.exe install --url ... --token ...` registers
  and starts it (auto-start, restart on failure), with `start` / `stop` / `status` / `uninstall`
  to manage it. Same single static binary, same outbound-only model. Config is read from the
  environment or a file the installer writes, so Linux/macOS behaviour is unchanged.
- **Geographic map mode (GitHub #11).** Toggle a map into geographic mode and your own device
  nodes sit over a real map background, positioned by each device's coordinates - set them from an
  address or by dragging on the map, or auto-filled from an SNMP location. Devices sharing a spot
  collapse into one stack node so a site doesn't turn into a pile of overlapping cards.
- **OSPF neighbours and link cost (GitHub #11).** Device tiles show the OSPF full-neighbour count,
  and links show the OSPF cost out of each end - read over the RouterOS API, including for MikroTiks
  that are otherwise polled over SNMP (attach a RouterOS API credential).
- **Export and import a map (GitHub #11).** Save a map's layout to a JSON file and import it back,
  to move a map between instances or keep a copy.
- **Free-text notes and labels on maps (GitHub #11).** Drop a note anywhere on a map to annotate it;
  colour it and drag it into place.
- **Real device links between child maps on an overview (GitHub #9).** An overview map can now show
  the actual device links that cross between the sub-maps placed on it, aggregated per pair and
  toggleable, so you can see the real wiring without a tangle.
- **More alerting and map detail (GitHub #10, #11).** Per-interface "port down" alerts, a
  low-throughput alert, link port-speed shown on the map, a per-device ping source address, a map
  breadcrumb for nested maps, and a custom sensor that can walk an SNMP table and reduce it to one
  value.

### Changed
- **Redis runs with persistence off (GitHub #16).** My Mate uses Redis only as a transient broker
  (queues, cache, broadcasting), so the packaged installs now disable RDB snapshots and AOF and
  never block writes on a failed save. This avoids the stock-Redis behaviour that, on large fleets,
  filled the disk with the RDB dump and spiked memory via `redis-check-rdb`. Applies to the
  `.deb`, LXC and Docker Compose; nothing of record lives in Redis, so there's no data to lose.
- Added [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) with CPU/RAM/disk sizing guidance and how history
  retention bounds disk use.

### Fixed
- Overview maps: child-map nodes can be detached from a canvas, and the empty-state and add-map
  flash were cleaned up.
- Geographic mode: dragging a device no longer zooms the map out, and fit-to-bounds no longer
  over-zooms when devices are close together.
- Removed a stray backslash that showed literally in a few UI strings.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Overview maps: child-map nodes and manual links (GitHub #9).** Place a map as a node on
  another map (Add map on the toolbar), double-click it to drill in, and draw links between
  those map-nodes to build a top-level topology - no device or interface needed. Nesting is
  cycle-guarded, nodes drag to reposition, and links drag to remove.
- **Links can be tagged by media type.** Fiber / Ethernet / Wireless / Other, styled on the
  map so link types read at a glance - manual overview links colour by medium, and device
  links keep their load colour but pick up the medium's line style (wireless dashes). Set it
  when creating a link, or click an overview link to change it.
- **Remote agents now report CPU / memory / temperature.** A device polled through a remote
  agent previously showed no resource metrics; the agent now reads cpu/mem/temp (SNMP by the
  same per-vendor OID profile the central poller uses, or the RouterOS API) and reports them
  back, so agent-monitored devices get the same tiles and history as centrally-polled ones.
- **Remote agents support SNMPv3.** The agent now authenticates with the full v3 USM parameter
  set (user, auth + privacy protocols/passphrases) for both polling and discovery, not just a
  v1/v2c community - matching the central poller.
- **Internet/upstream card shows latency, not load.** An internet device now displays its
  ping latency (and a packet-loss badge) instead of a load/cpu/mem tile, coloured by a
  per-device quality band you set in the device editor - green at or below the "good"
  threshold, red at or above the "bad" one, amber in between (defaults 30ms / 150ms).
  Latency updates live on the map as sweeps run.
- **Discovery probes SNMP, RouterOS and SSH per host.** A responding host is now tried
  against all three credential types in one pass, so both its poll credential (SNMP or
  RouterOS) and a matching SSH credential (for config backups) are linked when you approve
  it. A host that only matches SSH becomes a ping-only device with backups configured.
- **Credential tags in the review queue.** Each discovered host shows a tag for every
  credential that authenticated against it (SNMP / RouterOS / SSH, named), so you can see
  at a glance what it'll be polled and backed up with before approving it.
- **Live scan-progress on the discovery page.** A sweep in progress now shows a banner with
  an animated progress bar and the subnet(s) being scanned - for scheduled scans too, not
  just ones you kicked off - so it's obvious discovery is working while devices trickle in.
- **Remote-agent scans stream live progress.** The agent now reports a sweep as it runs
  (hosts pinged so far / total, and responders identified so far) instead of only at the end,
  so the discovery page shows a real progress bar and a live "found" count for agent scans -
  and the loop no longer stacks overlapping sweeps of the same subnet.
- **Remote agent as a `.deb`.**
- **Custom device icon and colour.** Edit a device to pick its map glyph from a set of
  role icons (router, switch, AP, dish, server, firewall, camera, NVR, and more) and tint
  it any colour - or leave it on Auto to keep the vendor/type icon. The chosen icon now
  shows identically on the map node and in the inspector header.

### Changed
- **Links with no known speed default to 1 Gbps.** When neither end of a link reports an
  interface speed (e.g. RouterOS returns 0 for ifSpeed over SNMP), the link now assumes a 1G
  circuit so it still colours by load instead of staying neutral grey. A per-link bandwidth
  override always wins, and ping-only links (no interface either end) stay neutral.

### Fixed
- **MikroTik product photos show again (model parsed from modern sysDescr).** Newer RouterOS
  reports its board name with the version appended ("RouterOS RB5009UPr+S+ 7.23.2 (stable)"),
  which the model parser's end-anchored pattern didn't match - so the model came back empty,
  the product-photo lookup had nothing to resolve, and the card fell back to the "MT" monogram.
  The board name is now read regardless of a trailing version, and a modelless build's bare
  version is no longer mistaken for a model. The map glyph also retries a freshly-fetched photo
  a few times so it appears without a page reload. (Modelless CHR virtual routers still show the
  MikroTik monogram - there's no product image for them.)
- **CPU / memory now read over SNMP for wired devices.** A device answering "no such object"
  for an OID it doesn't implement (e.g. a wired router or switch queried for a wireless-only
  signal OID) was treated as a total poll failure, so its cpu/mem/temp came back blank even
  though they were readable. Such an absent OID is now handled per-metric, so each metric is
  read independently as intended. Genuine transport failures (timeout/filtered) still isolate
  the device. Also fixed MikroTik temperature reading 10x too high (it's reported in tenths
  of a degree).
- **Links attach to the sides you drew them from.** Dragging a link now binds each end to
  the exact handle you started and finished on (e.g. bottom-to-top) instead of always
  springing the "from" end to the top of the node. Links drawn the old way, or via the Add
  link dialog, still auto-float to whichever sides face each other.
- **Remote-agent connections stay up, and offline is detected fast.** The hub sends a WebSocket
  keepalive ping to each connected agent every 30s (and the `/agent` proxy read timeout was
  raised to an hour), so a quiet link is no longer dropped by nginx or a stateful firewall.
  Each ping/pong refreshes the agent's heartbeat, and a reaper marks an agent offline if it goes
  silent for 90s - so a blackholed link (no TCP close) flips offline within ~a minute instead of
  looking online until the proxy timeout, and job dispatch/UI never treat a gone agent as live.
- **Discovery scans now find every responder.** Two bugs meant hosts that clearly respond
  (e.g. routers on `.253`/`.254`) were missed: fping was resolved via `PATH`, so a
  web-request context whose `PATH` omitted `/usr/local/sbin` couldn't find it and every
  sweep came back empty (now resolved by absolute path); and a `/24` sweep could exceed the
  scan job's timeout while probing serially, so late addresses were never reached (probing
  now runs within a time budget and defers the rest to the next sweep instead of timing out). The agent now ships as a Debian package (amd64 / arm64 /
  armhf) that asks for the server URL and agent token during install, writes the config,
  and sets up a hardened systemd service - `sudo apt install ./mymate-agent_<ver>_<arch>.deb`.
  Change it later with `dpkg-reconfigure mymate-agent`. Built and attached to releases by CI.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **SNMPv3.** Credentials can now use SNMPv3 (USM) alongside v1/v2c: pick a security
  level (noAuthNoPriv / authNoPriv / authPriv), an auth protocol (MD5, SHA, SHA-2) and
  a privacy protocol (DES, AES), with the passphrases stored encrypted. Central polling,
  discovery, device facts and custom sensors all authenticate with v3 where configured.
- **Add & edit devices from the map.** An Add device button on the map toolbar creates a
  device and drops it on the current map; the inspector gains an Edit device options
  dialog (name, IP, poll method, credential, type, and a monitoring on/off toggle) - no
  more round-trip to the Devices page.
- **Generic internet / uplink object.** Add a placeholder upstream node from the map
  (ping-only, defaults to pinging 1.1.1.1) and link a device's uplink interface back to
  it - so you can monitor an uplink even when the upstream device or port was never
  discovered.
- **Factory reset.** A clean-slate reset (the `mymate:factory-reset` command and an
  admin-only, password-confirmed Danger zone in Settings) wipes all monitoring data -
  devices, maps, credentials, history, everything - and keeps only admin accounts.
- **Cross-map links.** Link a device to any other device, including one on a different
  map, from the inspector's Add link button - search for the far end by name or IP,
  bind each interface, done. The link shows as a portal on each map where only one end
  is present. Previously links could only be drawn by dragging two devices together on
  the same map.
- **RouterOS upgrades: choose a version + package mirror.** Pick a specific RouterOS
  version (from the release channels or typed in) instead of only "latest", and
  choose where each router pulls the package from - straight from MikroTik, or from a
  local mirror. My Mate downloads the per-arch `.npk` once, caches it (served to
  routers over an unguessable token URL), and keeps it for 90 days (configurable,
  with manual delete). The chosen version is fetched onto the device and verified
  before it reboots. Managed on the Upgrades page.
- **Map restyle + device icons.** The topology map got a visual pass: a selected
  device now clearly stands out (emerald ring, halo, lift) and its links come forward
  while the rest fade back; a "blueprint" grid replaces the stock dot field; and a
  bespoke zoom/fit control cluster replaces the default one. Device tiles now show the
  real MikroTik product photo for the model - fetched from MikroTik and cached locally
  the first time that model is seen - falling back to a clean drawn family icon
  (router / switch / AP / dish / server) for everything else.
- **Latency, jitter and packet-loss monitoring.** The ping sweep now records
  round-trip time and loss per device (live values + history), charted in the
  device inspector's Health section - shown for ping-only devices too. High-metric
  alert rules gained latency and loss thresholds.
- **Maintenance windows.** Schedule a span (with a device scope) during which alerts
  are suppressed for the in-scope devices, so planned work doesn't page anyone - no
  false alarms while it's on, and no false recovery when it ends. Managed on the
  Alerts screen.
- **Alert acknowledgement** and **more notification channels.** Mark a fired alert
  as handled (recording who/when); and deliver via a generic Webhook, Discord,
  Telegram or PagerDuty in addition to email/Slack/Teams/Messenger.
- **Wireless / RF metrics.** Signal strength, SNR, connection quality and client
  count for wireless gear, in the Health section and pushed live to the map. Read
  over the RouterOS API (MikroTik) and over SNMP for **Ubiquiti airMAX** (signal /
  CCQ / client count) and **Cambium ePMP** (RSSI / SNR / connected-SM count) - each
  profile handles both AP mode (averaged across associated stations) and station/CPE
  mode. Vendor SNMP RF profiles are extensible via config.
- **Custom SNMP sensors.** Define your own OIDs to poll and graph (interface errors,
  PoE draw, UPS charge, a probe - anything the gear exposes), scoped to devices,
  with the value shown in the inspector. Managed in Settings.
- **SSH private keys on credentials.** An SSH credential can now authenticate with a
  pasted private key instead of (or alongside) a password. Stored encrypted, never
  returned.
- Alert rules for **failed config backups** and **high device metrics** (CPU,
  memory or temperature over a threshold). Both support the same targeting
  (all / device type / map / specific devices), sustained-duration gate and
  recovery notifications as the existing rules; high-metric ignores stale readings
  so a device that stopped reporting doesn't alert on a frozen value.
- The Dude import screen now has an **extraction time limit** control, so a very
  large `dude.db` (lots of chart history) can be given more time to reverse-engineer
  instead of being cut off. Also available on the CLI as `--extract-timeout`. (#3)
- **System status** panel in Settings: at-a-glance health for the database, Redis,
  background workers, the polling loop, the WebSocket server and the backup engine -
  so "why isn't X working?" is self-diagnosable.
- **Guided upgrade**: when a newer release is out, Settings now shows the release
  notes and the exact upgrade command for each install type (package, Docker, LXC),
  not just a "an update is available" note.
- The import screen shows the maximum upload size and checks the file before it
  uploads - an oversized `dude.db` is caught instantly (with the CLI import
  suggested) instead of failing after a long transfer, and very large files get a
  nudge toward the more reliable CLI import.

### Changed
- **Graceful upgrades.** The Debian package and Docker image now clear stale compiled
  caches (config/views/events) and always run migrations before restarting the
  workers, so new code never meets an old schema. The package also holds the console
  in maintenance mode during the migration and comes back up automatically. Added an
  Upgrading section to the README covering all three installs (LXC = install the new
  `.deb` into the container).
- The default upload size limit for a `dude.db` is now 4 GB (was 512 MB), across the
  app, nginx and PHP, so even the largest databases upload without tuning. Imports
  also get a generous whole-job time budget so a big history import isn't killed
  part-way through. (#3)
- Error notifications now wrap to show the full message and stay until dismissed,
  instead of being truncated to one line and disappearing after a few seconds (you
  couldn't read long errors like the import size message). (#3)
- The installer and first-boot now detect the machine's reachable IP via its default
  route when setting `APP_URL`, rather than the first `hostname -I` entry (which can
  be a secondary interface).
- Mobile: the console feels more app-like on phones and tablets - the page no longer
  rubber-bands or pull-to-refreshes when you drag the map, taps don't flash or
  double-tap-zoom, text doesn't inflate on rotation, and the chrome now respects
  device safe areas (notch / home indicator). Builds on the existing responsive
  layout (drawer navigation, off-canvas device inspector).

### Fixed
- The Dude import now brings in links the operator drew but wasn't bandwidth-monitoring.
  Previously only monitored links were imported; plain topology lines (which have no
  monitored-link object in the Dude DB) were dropped, so maps came in missing links. They
  now import as plain device-to-device links, skipping any pair a monitored link covers.
- The device LOAD tile no longer shows a dash when interface speed is unknown: it now
  falls back to the busiest interface's absolute throughput (e.g. 5.0M, 1.2G). The
  percentage form needs a known link speed, which RouterOS virtual interfaces and any
  port with no negotiated rate don't report.
- Device product photos now show reliably: SNMP model capture no longer stores raw board
  ids (like `0x0002`) that can't map to a product page, the map glyph skips the lookup
  for unresolvable models, and the icon cache is written world-readable so a packaged
  install's web user can serve it.
- The map list scrolls when it's longer than the screen (previously it just ran off the
  bottom with no way to reach the maps below).
- Native dropdowns and number inputs in the credential and device forms no longer render
  white-on-white in dark mode.
- The latest-config viewer opens as a full-window modal instead of being trapped inside
  the inspector sidebar.
- The Settings "System status" panel no longer reports the polling loop as stopped
  right after an upgrade: it falls back to recent polling activity when the loop's
  heartbeat is stale (the long-running loop process may not have restarted yet).
- Login on an LXC/VM would flash the first screen and bounce straight back to the
  login page when the instance was reached by an address that wasn't baked into
  `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS` at first boot (a changed/DHCP IP, a hostname or DNS
  name). The app is served same-origin, so it now trusts the address the browser
  actually uses for cookie auth - no `.env` editing needed. (#4)
- Docker: `dude.db` uploads through the browser were capped at PHP's 2 MB default
  (the image had no upload override). The image now allows the full 4 GB.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- RouterOS device metrics (CPU / memory / temperature) and device facts
  (vendor / model / uptime) are captured over the API again. The API calls were
  missing the `/print` action, which real RouterOS rejects with "no such command",
  so every MikroTik silently reported nothing in 1.1.0. SNMP devices were not
  affected.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- Device resource metrics: CPU, memory and temperature per device, over SNMP
  (per-vendor OID profiles) or the RouterOS API. Shown on the map tiles and the
  device list, with history charts in the inspector.
- Rolling firmware upgrades page: pick devices, get a dependency-ordered plan
  (furthest-downstream first, with the topology shown), reorder it by hand, then
  run it one device at a time - each upgrade waits for the previous device to come
  back online so a reboot never cuts the path.
- Backups page: set an automatic backup schedule, browse every stored config
  version from the git-backed store, and diff any two versions.
- The config backup engine (Rusted) is now bundled and auto-provisioned by the
  `.deb`, Proxmox LXC and Docker installs, so device backups work out of the box.
- Per-device SSH credentials, separate from the SNMP / RouterOS polling credential.
- MikroTik key-based SSH bootstrap: install a generated SSH key on a device over
  the RouterOS API, then back it up over SSH (RouterOS won't hand its config back
  over the API).
- A full device edit dialog (name, IP, poll method, credential, type, parent) with
  an enable/disable-monitoring toggle, and a `mymate:user:admin` command to grant
  or revoke admin from the CLI.
- Credential picker on the add-device form and the inspector, so an SNMP/RouterOS
  device actually gets a community/login instead of failing discovery.
- Links to ping-only devices: bind a link from the interface end when the other
  end has none.
- Update check: Settings shows when a newer release is available on GitHub.

### Fixed
- Mangled apostrophes that showed a literal backslash in several dialogs.
