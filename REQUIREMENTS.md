# Requirements and sizing

My Mate runs comfortably on modest hardware. The numbers below are practical guidance, not hard
limits - the honest way to size is to start on the small end and watch disk/CPU/memory for a week,
since it depends on your fleet size, poll cadence, and how long you keep history.

Some of these figures come from a real production instance monitoring **~2700 devices** (thanks
to the operator who shared them in #16).

## What drives resource use

- **Devices + poll cadence** drive CPU (fping sweeps, SNMP/RouterOS polls) and the write rate.
- **History retention** drives disk. Interface throughput, device metrics (cpu/mem/temp), ping
  latency and custom sensors are written every poll into daily-partitioned tables, and partitions
  older than the retention window are dropped automatically. Default retention is **14 days**
  (Settings -> Engine, `history.retention_days`). Disk use plateaus once you reach that window.
  On top of that, 5 minute and hourly rollups are kept much longer for the long graph ranges
  (defaults 30 and 400 days, `history.rollup_5m_days` / `history.rollup_1h_days`). They're far
  smaller than raw: roughly 1.4 GB per 1000 interfaces for 30 days of 5 minute rollups and
  1.6 GB per 1000 interfaces for 400 days of hourly ones. Device metrics plus ping come to
  roughly twice that per 1000 devices (more columns per row). Shorten either tier in Settings if
  that's too much.
  The port packet / error / discard rates and port up % roughly double the width of an interface
  rollup row, so budget about twice the interface figures above. Raw interface samples barely grow
  (over SNMP the counters are only filled in once a minute, the rest of the row stays null). Per-CPU,
  storage and optical history are small next to that: a row per core, per disk or memory entry and
  per SFP, on the metrics cadence.
- **Redis** is a transient broker (queues, cache, live broadcasting). It holds no durable data -
  everything of record is in PostgreSQL - so it is provisioned with persistence off (see below).

## Rough sizing

| Fleet | CPU | RAM | Disk (/opt + Postgres) |
|-------|-----|-----|------------------------|
| up to ~250 devices | 2 cores | 4 GB | 20 GB |
| ~250-1000 | 2-4 cores | 4-8 GB | 40 GB |
| ~1000-3000 | 4-6 cores | 8-12 GB | 60-100 GB |

Reference point (~2700 devices, ~10 days uptime, default 14-day retention): load average ~0.8-1.15
on 6 cores (4 would be fine), ~8 GB RAM in use, and disk sitting around `/opt` 15 GB, PostgreSQL
4.5 GB, Redis ~5 GB. Disk was still climbing toward the 14-day plateau at that point.

## Disk

Give the data room and, ideally, keep it off the OS disk so it is easy to grow later. The operator
in #16 puts `/opt`, PostgreSQL and Redis on separate LVM volumes for exactly this - recommended if
you run at scale.

- **`/opt/mymate`** - the app plus its history tables. This is the main grower; size it for
  `~(daily history) x (retention_days)` plus headroom. Lower `history.retention_days` to save disk,
  raise it for longer trends.
- **PostgreSQL** (`/var/lib/postgresql`) - device/interface/link metadata plus the partitioned
  sample tables. Grows with fleet size and retention.
- **Redis** (`/var/lib/redis`) - see below.

If any of these fills up, monitoring degrades. Watch them, or split them onto their own volumes.

## Redis

My Mate uses Redis only as a transient broker, so **persistence is turned off** by the packaged
installs - no RDB snapshots, no AOF, and a failed background save never blocks writes. This avoids
the two problems large fleets hit with the stock Redis defaults: the RDB dump filling the disk, and
`redis-check-rdb` / the snapshot fork spiking memory (#16). The trade-off is that Redis data (queued
jobs, cache, sessions) is lost on a Redis restart, which is fine here - the poll loop re-populates,
and nothing of record lives there.

The packaged installs also set a **memory ceiling** (`maxmemory` at 40% of RAM, `maxmemory-policy
allkeys-lru`) so Redis can never grow until the kernel OOM-kills it and takes monitoring down with
it. Because nothing in Redis is durable, evicting under pressure is safe - the poll loop rebuilds
its working set on the next tick. Live map updates (interface load, device metrics, up/down) are
broadcast inline rather than queued, so a large fleet's per-tick update stream no longer piles up
in Redis waiting to be delivered - the single biggest source of runaway Redis memory before.

The `.deb`/LXC installs apply this automatically; the Docker Compose Redis service is started with
the same flags. If you run your own Redis, the equivalent settings are:

```
save ""
appendonly no
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error no
maxmemory <~40% of RAM>
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

If Redis memory ever climbs toward the ceiling, check for a queue backlog (`redis-cli INFO
keyspace`, and the `*queues*` list lengths) - it usually means the poll workers can't keep up, so
raise `mymate.poll.shards` and the `poll` worker count rather than just giving Redis more RAM.

## CPU and memory

- **CPU**: 4 cores is a good target for a few thousand devices; scale up if you shorten the poll
  interval or add a lot of SNMP sensors. Load is dominated by the poll workers and history writes.
- **Memory**: 8 GB is comfortable at a few thousand devices. Leave headroom and keep some swap.
- ICMP up/down monitoring needs raw-socket capability - the installer sets this up and refuses to
  install if the host can't do it.
