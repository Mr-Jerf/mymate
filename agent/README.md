# My Mate remote agent

A lightweight **probe** you run inside a management network. It dials an outbound encrypted
WebSocket to the central My Mate app and polls/discovers devices locally - so an out-of-band
(SaaS) install never needs the management network exposed to the internet.

A single **static Go binary** (no runtime dependencies) - the same build runs on a VM, a
container, or a Raspberry Pi.

## Platforms

| OS | Arch | Target |
|----|------|--------|
| Linux  | amd64 | servers / VMs / containers |
| Linux  | arm64 | Raspberry Pi 4/5 (64-bit), ARM servers |
| Linux  | arm (v7) | older 32-bit Raspberry Pi |
| macOS  | arm64 | Apple Silicon |
| macOS  | amd64 | Intel Mac |
| Windows | amd64 | Windows servers / workstations (install as a service) |
| Windows | arm64 | Windows on ARM |

On Windows the agent installs itself as a service - see
[packaging/windows-install.md](packaging/windows-install.md).

## Install

First, on the app, enrol the agent and copy its token:

```sh
php artisan mymate:agent:create "Site A"
```

### Debian / Ubuntu (.deb) - recommended

Download the `.deb` for your architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`, `armhf`) from the release and:

```sh
sudo apt install ./mymate-agent_1.2.0_amd64.deb
```

It asks for the **server URL** and **agent token** during install, writes
`/etc/mymate-agent/agent.env` (root-only), and enables the systemd service. To change the
settings later: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure mymate-agent`. Preseed a non-interactive install with
`debconf-set-selections` (keys `mymate-agent/url` and `mymate-agent/token`).

### Any Linux / macOS (archive)

Download the archive for your platform, unpack it, and:

```sh
sudo ./install.sh --url https://mymate.example.com --token mma_xxxxx
```

That installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin/mymate-agent` and registers a service that
starts at boot and restarts on failure - **systemd** on Linux, **launchd** on macOS.

- Linux logs: `journalctl -u mymate-agent -f`
- macOS logs: `tail -f /var/log/mymate-agent.log`

### MikroTik RouterOS container (or any Docker host)

Each release also ships a small agent-only container image (~7 MB) as a `docker save`
tarball per arch: `mymate-agent-image_<version>_linux_{amd64,arm64,armv7}.tar`. That lets
a site's own RouterOS 7 router run the agent in its container feature, Dude style, with no
extra box. Step by step setup is in [ROUTEROS.md](ROUTEROS.md) (not yet tested on real
RouterOS hardware, feedback welcome). Configure it with the same env vars as below.

## Configuration

Environment variables (see `packaging/agent.env.example`):

| Var | Required | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `MYMATE_URL` | yes | app URL; `http(s)://` is rewritten to `ws(s)://` + `/agent` |
| `MYMATE_AGENT_TOKEN` | yes | from `mymate:agent:create` |
| `MYMATE_AGENT_NAME` | no | label reported to the server (default: hostname) |
| `MYMATE_AGENT_LOG` | no | `info` (default) or `debug` |
| `MYMATE_AGENT_INSECURE` | no | `1` skips TLS verification (self-signed dev only) |

## Recovery

Two layers: the agent **reconnects in-process** with exponential backoff + jitter if the
link drops, and the **service manager** (systemd `Restart=always` / launchd `KeepAlive`)
restarts the process if it ever exits.

## Build from source

```sh
./build.sh host        # this machine -> bin/mymate-agent
VERSION=v1.0.0 ./build.sh   # all platforms -> dist/*.tar.gz (+ SHA256SUMS)

# Debian packages (needs dpkg-deb):
VERSION=1.0.0 ARCH=amd64 packaging/build-deb.sh   # -> dist/mymate-agent_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

Needs Go 1.25+. CI builds the archives and the `.deb`s on every release tag.

## Discovery

The agent also **discovers** devices on its own network. In the console, add a scan range
(Settings -> discovery) and choose *Scan via agent: <name>*; the agent ping-sweeps that CIDR,
probes responders with the credential pool (SNMP, then RouterOS), and the results land in the
usual review queue - so devices behind the agent are found from the inside, never scanned
across the internet.
