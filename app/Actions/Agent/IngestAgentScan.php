/**
 * Takes a remote agent's scan results and drops them into the same review queue the central
 * scanner uses. New, identified responders become discovery_candidate rows (we never auto-add
 * a device), and we stamp last_scanned_at on each subnet so its cadence moves on.
 *
 * The agent already did the ping sweep + credential probing locally (inside the mgmt network),
 * so all we do here is apply the same queueing rules as {@see \App\Actions\Discovery\ScanSubnet}:
 * skip IPs that are already devices, bump last_seen for ones we've already got (don't re-trial,
 * don't bring back an ignored candidate), and only queue hosts we actually identified over
 * snmp/routeros. A host that just answers ping has nothing to poll so it's no use to us.
 *
 * Security: an agent can only report on subnets that are assigned to it. Anything else we drop.
 *
 * @phpstan-type ScanCandidate array{ip:string, sysname?:string, method?:string, credential_id?:int}
