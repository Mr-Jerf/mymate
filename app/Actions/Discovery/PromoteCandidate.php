/**
 * Approve a discovery candidate -> create the real `device` (carrying the matched
 * credential + detected poll_method) and kick a first discovery + poll so it
 * populates immediately. Marks the candidate `approved` so a re-scan won't re-offer
 * it (and its IP is now a device, which the scanner skips anyway).
 *
 * Idempotent on the device: if a device already exists at the candidate's IP we
 * reuse it rather than creating a duplicate. The "does a device exist?" check
 * below is inherently a check-then-act race under READ COMMITTED (a double-click
 * "Approve" could see no device twice before either commits) - the real guarantee
 * is the DB-level unique index on `devices.mgmt_ip` (migration
 * `2026_07_01_000003`, found via adversarial review); the loser's insert fails and
 * is caught here, re-fetching the winner's row instead of erroring.
