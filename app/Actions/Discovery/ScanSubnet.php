/**
 * Sweep one subnet for new devices. CIDR -> batched fping sweep -> for each
 * responder that isn't already a device, probe the read-only credential pool and
 * queue it as a `discovery_candidate` (review queue - never auto-added).
 *
 * Safety (NFR-10): host count is capped by Scanner; only **genuinely new** IPs are
 * credential-probed (a re-scan just bumps `last_seen`), which keeps credential
 * trials minimal and never resurrects an ignored candidate. Returns new-candidate count.
